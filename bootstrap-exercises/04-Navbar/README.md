# `04` Navbar

As developers, we are constantly doing menus the same way: Using `ul` tag, removing the bullet from the `li`, displaying the list in-line, etc.

Bootstrap helps us a lot by introducing the class `nav` that can behave in several ways.

In this case, we have the typical `ul` needed to create a menu, but without any CSS styles applied yet.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. **Build** and then **preview** the exercise.

2. Apply the classes to the code just like in this example: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navs-tabs/#base-nav

3. **Build** and then **preview** again to compare the differences.

4. Now add the `nav-tabs` class to the same `ul` (without removing the class nav) and compare the results.
