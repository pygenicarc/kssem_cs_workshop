# `02` Bootstrap Skeleton

If you want to import Bootstrap to your website, you can use this public URL that is available to everybody:

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-EVSTQN3/azprG1Anm3QDgpJLIm9Nao0Yz1ztcQTwFspd3yD65VohhpuuCOmLASjC" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

When using Bootstrap, you have to wrap all of your content within the following **container** classes:

```html
<div class="container"></div>
```
OR

```html
<div class="container-fluid"></div>
```


## 📝 Instructions:

1. Link the Bootstrap CSS Stylesheet with the document using the `<link>` tag you find above.

2. Wrap the content of the website within a `<div>` with a `container` and `bg-secondary` classes. 

3. **Build** and then **preview** the exercise to compare the differences.

4. Now change the class of the `<div>` you've just created to `container-fluid` and `bg-secondary` classes.

5. **Build** and then **preview** again and compare the differences.


## 🔎 Important:

To understand the difference between both `container` classes, you have to make the `<div>` container smaller and bigger. There is `margin-left: auto` and `margin-right: auto` to center the container; whereas the content in the `container-fluid` class spans through all the page's width.
