# `06` Specificity

When creating a CSS document, you need to start from the most generic selectors and end with the most specific ones, that is the way CSS works.

It's all about the level of **specificity**. If you specify that your `div` with `id="thirditem` has a yellow background, and later in the document you specify that all `divs` will have blue background, `#thirditem` will keep his yellow background. punto!

*Because the more specific, the more priority it has.* 

## üìù Instructions:

1. Override the `background` of `#thirditem` without deleting any CSS code, simply append to the CSS a more specific rule at the end of the document to override the background-color to green.

## üí° Hint:

You can use the `!important` annotation:
