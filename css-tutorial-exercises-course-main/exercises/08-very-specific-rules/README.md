# `08` Very Specific Rules

## 🔎 Important:

In this exercise, you can add your code only above the **READ-ONLY BLOCK** of the code, you can add as many lines as you want, but always above.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Set the `ul li` text color to `red` (override conflicts with specificity).

2. Set the `background-color` of the second `li` of the `ol` to `green` (don't use the #id selector or .class selector).

3. Change the odd rows of the tables to a yellow background using `tr:nth-child`.

> Important: You should **NOT** modify the `index.html` file.

## 💡 Hint:

- The `!important` attribute helps to override other attributes.
