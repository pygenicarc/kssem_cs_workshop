# `03.1` Background

The `background` CSS rule allows us to assign and work with the background of any container. The background values can be a `color` or an `image`.

If it is an image, you can specify if you want the image to be repeated horizontally, vertically, or both, or not at all, and you can also specify if you want it to resize and fit the whole container where it is being applied, among other properties that can be modified.

## üìù Instructions:

1.  Run the exercise.

2.  Check the Preview.

3.  On the styles.css file change the background-size to 'contain' (check the styles.css tab).

4.  Run and Preview the exercise again.

5.  Change the background-repeat to 'repeat' to make it repeat over the x-axis and y-axis.

6.  Run and Preview the exercise again.


## üí° Hint:

Google is your best friend:

- We recommend googling: `css background-size` and reading about it on w3schools or any other websites.
- We also recommend googling about `css background-repeat`.
