# `05` Class Selector

There are many ways to select HTML elements to apply styles to them, so far we have only used the `tag` selector, so let's talk about the `.class` selector:

## `.class` Selector

It is the most popular CSS selector, you will probably use it every 5 minutes.

Use the class property of the HTML element to select it. Styling rules will apply to all elements with the same class value

```css
.small{
    font-size: 9px;
}
```

*Any HTML tag with the `class="small"` will have a font-size of `9px`.*

## üìù Instructions:

1. Right now there is a class selected on the CSS that is called `b-blue`. 

2. Please apply that class to both of the HTML `<p>` tags.
