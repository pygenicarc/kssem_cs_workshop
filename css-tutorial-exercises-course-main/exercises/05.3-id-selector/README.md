# `05.3` The ID CSS Selector

You can also select an element by `#id` and apply styles to it.

## The `#id` selector

```css
#small{
    font-size: 9px;
}
```

Use the `id` property of the HTML element to select it. `ids` should be unique, don't use the same `id` on more than one element.

*The HTML tag with the `id="small"` will have a font-size of `9px`.*

## üìù Instructions:

1. Add the id `button1` on to the `<span>` tag and compile to check the result on the console.
