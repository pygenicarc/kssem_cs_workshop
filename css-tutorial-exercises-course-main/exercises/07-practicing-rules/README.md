# `07` Practicing Rules

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Set this URL as the background image of the page, and repeat it vertically only: `../../.learn/assets/background-vertical.jpg?raw=true`

2. Change the `font-family` of the `h1` to `Courier` and the rest of the website to `Times new Roman`.

3. Change the color of `h1` to `red`.

4. Make all the `h2` have an `underline`.

5. Add a `left padding` to the whole document of `20px` to make it easier to read.

6. Add a white `semi-transparent background (0.2)` to the **first paragraph** to make it easier to read (you have to use `rgba` for that).

7. Then apply a `padding` of `5px` to all sides of that paragraph.

8. Change the `anchor` **hover** color to `green` and remove the underline (you have to actually hover the anchor to test it).
