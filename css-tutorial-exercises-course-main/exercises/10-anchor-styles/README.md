# `10` 3D Anchor Styles

People like to feel that they are clicking on something, a great approach to accomplish that is by faking a 3D effect. To do so, designers normally play with the borders, for example:

You can control what CSS rules apply to each state of an anchor by using the `:hover` (for mouse hover) or `:active` (for mouse pressing) selectors, example:

```css
a:active {
  /* here you can specify whatever CSS rule that applies
  to the anchor while being 'pressed' */
}
```

## üìù Instructions:

1. Change the border colors of the anchor, when being pressed, to the following:

```css
border-color: #000 #aaa #aaa #000;
```
