# `02.3` Your Second Style

When doing CSS, the idea is to apply `css rules` to your `html elements`, you always have to select the element first, and then specify what rules you want to apply to it:

For example, this is the code if you want to make all your website anchors (`<a>` tags) blue:

```css
a {
  color: blue;
}
```

## üìù Instructions:

1. Make your website background blue by selecting the `body` and applying the `background` rule with a `blue` value.

2. Run and preview the exercise and your result should be a blue `body` (the whole page blue).
