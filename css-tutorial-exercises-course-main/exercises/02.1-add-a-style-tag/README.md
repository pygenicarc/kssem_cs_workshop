# `02.1` The Style Tag

The previous exercise had a pre-writen `<style>` tag.
Let's add one style tag ourselves. It is recommended to have only one style tag, always at the beginning of your website code.

```html
<style>
    /* The website CSS Styles go here */
</style>
```

## 📝 Instructions

1. Add a `<style>` tag to your website and using CSS select all `<p>` tags to turn their text to color `blue`.

## 💻 Preview

It should look like this:
