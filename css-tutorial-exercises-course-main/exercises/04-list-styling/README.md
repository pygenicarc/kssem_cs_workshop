# `04` List styling

In the front end, we often have to list items, and the way to do that is with `<ul>` tags, for unordered/bulleted lists, and `<ol>` tags for ordered/numbered lists.  

We have CSS control over what these lists look like, what bullets or numbers they use, etc.

For example:

```html
    ul {
        list-style-type: none;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
    }
```

This will remove the numbers or bullets and will move the text to the left so there is no empty space where the bullets once were.

**Note:** 

Run the existing code first to see what the page originally looks like.
Then make the changes below and run again.  

## üìù Instructions:

1. Make the Coca Cola drinks numbers into lowercase letters. 
2. Make the Pepsi drinks numbers into square bullets.
3. Make the Healthy drinks bullets into Armenian numbers.
4. Completely remove the bullets from the web-developer drinks.

- Changing bullets into numbers and vice versa means that you would need to change the type of list - ordered or unordered. Changes in the HTML tags may be necessary. 
- `armenian` is an actual possible value of `list-style-type`: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_list-style-type.asp
