# `02.2` Your First Style

When doing CSS, the idea is to apply `css rules` to your `html elements`, you always have to select the element first, and then specify what rules you want to apply to it:

For example, this is the code if you want to make all your website anchors (`<a>` tags) blue:

```css
a {
  color: blue;
}
```

## üìù Instructions:

1. Right now there is a style being applied that is responsible for making the anchor `red`.

2. Change the style to make your anchor look `yellow`.
