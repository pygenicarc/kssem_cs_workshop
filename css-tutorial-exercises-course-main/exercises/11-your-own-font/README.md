# `11` Your Own Font

You can find Google Fonts here: https://fonts.google.com

Pick your favorite one, and then use it by linking your website with the URL in which the font is stored. You have to do that in the `<head>` tag of the HTML document like this:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=YOUR_FONT" rel="stylesheet"/>
```

After your font is linked, you need to assign the `font-family` CSS rule to whatever you want to apply the font, for example an `<h1>`.

## üìù Instructions:

1. Link any google-font that you like into the website.

2. Apply that specific `font-family` to `.myTitle`.
