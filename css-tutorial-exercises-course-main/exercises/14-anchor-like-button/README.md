# `14` Anchor Like Button

Anchors are not only used within text: when you are going to use anchors outside text, it is better to make them look like buttons for a more user-friendly experience.

## üìù Instructions:

1. Make it look like a box: set `padding` to `10px`.

2. Rounded borders: set `border-radius` to `4px`.

3. The `background` should be `orange` when not hovered, and `darkorange` on hover (`:hover`).

4. Remove underline: set `text-decoration` to `none`.

5. Set the color of the text to `white`.

+ *To make the button look different when the user hovers over with the mouse, we use the `:hover` selector: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.php*

6. Inside of the `:hover` selector change the background of the button to `darkorange`.
